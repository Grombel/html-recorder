# HTML-Recorder

## A mini-app that allows you to record input from the user's microphone directly in the browser using Javascript

This mini-app will allow you to capture audio input from the user's microphone directly in the browser using javascript and after the recording is done, it will let you
download the resulting audio file to your computer in a WAV format.

The sample app needs to be run in a web server, locally the example will not work. If you have Python installed on your computer, you can run this command to fire up
a demo server so you can taste the app:

    1. cd html-recorder
    2. python -m SimpleHTTPServer

P.S. Based on [Recorder JS][2]
